# AIR - Artificial Intelligence Radio
A C++ project that composes music, performs it via MIDI, converts it to .wav and hosts continuous newly generated music. It uses Discord integration to get votes for a neural network that help AIR generate better music.

# Examples of songs generated by AIR
Located in [src/RadioHost/saved songs](src/RadioHost/saved%20songs)

## Running AIR
* Download the repository
* install the apt aplay package
* If you are planning on running with discord integration:
  * make the file $HOME/airadio/broadcastbotkey.txt
  * make the file $HOME/airadio/pollingbotkey.txt
  * install the apt python3 package
* make and run *'./AIR'* in a terminal.
See the man page for any program options and other info
